``Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance. Repentance is not an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind. When coupled with faith, repentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

Whether you are diligently moving along the covenant path, have slipped or stepped from the covenant path, or canâ€™t even see the path from where you are now, I plead with you to repent. Experience the strengthening power of daily repentance --- of doing and being a little better each day.

When we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy --- the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent, we choose to become more like Jesus Christ!"

--- President Russell M. Nelson (We Can Do Better and Be Better)
