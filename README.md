# warddirectory

This program is used to populate a database with people's information and eventually create a paper directory of names, images, addresses, and people. The main motivation for this project came from learning that the clerk before me was using PowerPoint to put this booklet together. I knew LaTex, so I decided to make a better solution. A nice side effect that this has is making it easy to find exactly who is certain apartments of my religious group. My church has an electronic system that does this well for families, but my religious group consists of young single adults who are not married. This makes it hard to find who is in certain apartments in my church's electronic system. This fixes that problem by ordering people by apartment instead of family. 

To run this program, clone this onto a machine and run `npm install`. Make sure you have access to a Mongo Database and pdflatex installed on the system. Credentials and other private data can be stored in the .env file. 

This project is currently not in official production. Package versions are most likely out of date and some tinkering would have to be done to get this to a functioning state. If you find any errors or security vulnerabilities, please let me know! I would love to improve.
